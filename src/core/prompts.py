    """You are an LLM that edits prolog files. You are given
- a C program annotated with ACSL
- a prolog file used to generate input parameters for a C program

Steps:
1. Identify the preconditions defined in the ACSL annotations of the c program. 
    a. They are defined as "requires" clauses (e.g. /*@ requires x > 0 */)
    b. List dimensions are defined with the "valid" keyword clauses (e.g. /*@ requires \\valid(x+10 */)
    c. Quantified expressions are defined with the "forall" keyword clauses (e.g. /*@ requires \\forall int i; 0 <= i < 10 ==> x[i] > 0 */)

2. Edit the prolog file to generate input parameters that satisfy the preconditions defined in the ACSL annotations of the c program
    a. For list variable instantiations, make sure that the dimension is big enough (e.g. create_input_val(dim('tab'),int([0..9]),Ins) will create a list of size up to 10)
    b. Don't use integer values that are too large or too small. For example use the dimensions [0..99] rather than [-2147483648..2147483647]
    c. Don't try to perform arithmetic or comparisons in the variable instantitiations. Instead create a quantified/unquantified condition if you need to
    d. To create unquanfified expressions, use the "unquantif_preconds" function like below  which assures that the list called tab is at least size 3 and also larger than x and y
        unquantif_preconds('testme', [
            c(supegal, dim('tab'),3,  pre),
            c(supegal, dim('tab'), 'x', pre),
            c(supegal, dim('tab'), 'y', pre)
        ]).
    e. To create quantified expressions, use the "quantif_preconds" function like below which specifies that for all indicies greater than or equal to 1, the value at index I is greater than the value at index I - 1
        quantif_preconds('testme', 
            [Index],[c(supegal,Index,1,pre)],
            supegal,
            e('tab',I),
            e('tab',I â€“ 1)),
            pre)
        ]).
    f. Addition and subtraction operation are handled using the <operator>(i(math)<val1>,<val2>) syntax in quantified/unquantified preconditions. For example the following qunatified precond states that for all UQV1 where UQV1 is greater than or equal to 1, the element at A[UQV1] >= A[UQV1 - 1].
        quantif_preconds('testme',[uq_cond([UQV1],
                                   [c(supegal,UQV1,1,pre)],
                                   supegal,
                                   e('A',UQV1),
                                   e('A',-(i(math),UQV1,1)),
                                   pre)]).

    g. The conditional operators are as fallows: inf|infegal|sup|supegal|egal|diff 
    h. Accessing an element of an Array in quantified/unquantified preconditions is done using the e('<variable>', <idx>) syntax
    i. Do not use macros like INT_MAX or INT_MIN for ranges

1. Identify the preconditions defined in the ACSL annotations of the c program. 
    a. They are defined as "requires" clauses (e.g. /*@ requires x > 0 */)
    b. List dimensions are defined with the "valid" keyword clauses (e.g. /*@ requires \\valid(x+10 */)

2. Describe all of the preconditions you identified in the ACSL
3. Produce a C function called {main}_precond that uses C logic to check if given input parameters satisfy the preconditions describes above
    a. it returns a nonzero value if the input respects the preconditions, and zero otherwise
    b. {main}_precond should have the same function parameters (both name and type) as the {main} function in the provided program.
