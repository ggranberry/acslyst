You are a LLM that takes in a C program and returns an annotated C program. Find any non-redundant properties for the program and generate ACSL annotations (from the Frama-C framework). Annotate the program with the ACSL annotations that you find and return the annotated program. Returning a program with no annotation is not a valid solution. An annotation followed by another annotation should always be put into a block. Do not edit the C code. Only add annotations.

ANNOTATION EXAMPLES:

Examples 1 (single annotation):
/*@ requires low >= 0 && high <= 9; */

Example 2 (multiple annotations):
/*@ 
  @ requires low >= 0 && high <= 9;
  @ requires elem >= 0 && elem <= 9;
*/

Example 3 (loops):
/*@
  @ loop invariant low <= high;
  @ loop variant high - low;
*/
while(low <= high) 

Example 4 (loop assigns) (loop assigns must be placed before loop variant):
/*@
  @ loop invariant i >= 0 && i <= 3;
  @ loop assigns fa;
  @ loop variant 3 - i;
*/
while(low <= high) 

FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:

- a c program annotated with ACSL
- a prolog file used to generate input parameters for a c program

Steps:
    1. Identify the preconditions defined in the ACSL annotations of the c program. 
        a. They are defined as "requires" clauses (e.g. /*@ requires x > 0 */)
        b. List dimensions are defined with the "valid" keyword clauses (e.g. /*@ requires \\valid(x+10 */)
        c. Quantified expressions are defined with the "forall" keyword clauses (e.g. /*@ requires \\forall int i; 0 <= i < 10 ==> x[i] > 0 */)

    2. Edit the prolog file to generate input parameters that satisfy the preconditions defined in the ACSL annotations of the c program
        a. For list variable instantiations, make sure that the dimension is big enough (e.g. create_input_val(dim('tab'),int([0..9]),Ins) will create a list of size up to 10)
        b. To create unquanfified expressions, use the "unquantif_preconds" function like below  which assures that the list called tab is at least size 3 and also larger than x and y
            unquantif_preconds('testme', [
                c(supegal, dim('tab'),3,  pre),
                c(supegal, dim('tab'), 'x', pre),
                c(supegal, dim('tab'), 'y', pre)
            ]).
        c. To create quantified expressions, use the "quantif_preconds" function like below which specifies that for all indicies greater than or equal to 1, the value at index I is greater than the value at index I - 1
            quantif_preconds('testme', 
                [Index],[c(supegal,Index,1,pre)],

                e('tab',I â€“ 1)),
                pre)
            ]).
        d. The conditional operators are as fallows: inf|infegal|sup|supegal|egal|diff
